postfwd3 2.XX
=============
- feature: Added warnings for use of = to specify a regex in an item,
           due to this historical behaviour sometimes causing subtle
		   misconfigurations, e.g. sender=alice@example.org matching
		   malice@exampleforged.com.

           If you encounter these warnings, please review your
		   configuration, change to =~ if a regex match is intended,
		   or perhaps == for a literal match if appropriate. Note that
		   =~ does not allow the use of // around its argument, so remove
		   those if present.

		   These warnings are enabled by default, and can be suppressed
		   with --allow_default_regex, or turned into fatal errors with
		   --forbid_default_regex.

postfwd3 2.03
=============
- bugfix:  Corrected bug with --delrate command in v1 mode
           (Patch by Andreas Jobs, thanks)

postfwd3 2.02
=============
- bugfix:  Corrected bug in sendmail() function
- bugfix:  Fixed log warning in ipv6 rbl code (git issue #22)

postfwd3 2.01
=============
- code:    Workaround for Net::Server::Multiplex failure on CentOS 6
- code:    Documentation updates

postfwd3 2.00
=============
- code:    First public release Version of postfwd3.
	   This release will obsolete postfwd1 and postfwd2 when
	   it leaves pre-release stage.

- code:	   General:
	   postfwd3 lets you choose between Multiplex and PreFork personality.
	   Please look at the manpage or at postfwd.org/doc.html for the
	   --personality argument. if not specified, postfwd chooses the
	   personality-type by the program-name ("postfwd" and "postfwd1" mean
	   "Multiplex", "postfwd2" means PreFork).
- code:    postfwd now takes commands as arguments, e.g.
	   'postfwd stop' or 'postfwd reload'. Please see the manpage
	   for more information

- feature: Dynamic groups:
	   Dynamic groups allow to store request items like "client_address"
	   or "sender" in groups, which can be queried or modified at
	   runtime. Please read the manual section about "DYNAMIC GROUPS".
- feature: arguments --load_groups and --keep_groups allows to save
	   the contents of the dynamic group cache

- feature: Multiple actions per rule:
	   A rule can have multiple postfwd actions now.
	   Example:
		# if client is found on list.dnswl.org,
		#   1. send a note
		#   2. add it's ip to group %%WHITELISTED
		#   3. permit the request
		id=ADDR01
		        rbl=list.dnswl.org
		        action=note(adding $$client_address to WHITELIST)
		        action=groupadd(%%WHITELISTED/client_address)
		        action=PERMIT_AUTH_DESTINATION

- code:    IPv6 support:
	   postfwd3 optionally uses NetAddr:IP for cidr-compare functions
	   if available, which allows better IPv6 matching. Please note
	   that former versions used regex-matching for v6 addresses and
	   adapt your rulesets if required.
- code:	   postfwd3 optionally uses Net::CIDR::Lite for cidr-compare
           if available. It seems a bit faster than NetAddr::IP and
	   allows better IPv6 matching than the old method. Please look
	   into the manual for the following options and defaults:
		--cidr_method=<s>, --no_netcidr and --no_netaddr
- code:    IPv6 Support (requires NetAddr::IP module) for
	   dnsbl lookups (fixed 'reverse_address' item)
	   Use the --ipv6_dnsbl switch to enable this feature

- feature: Docker support:
	   Since version 1.36+ postfwd can be run in a docker container.
	   Script: postfwd-docker: shortcut to run postfwd commands in
	   a container (found in docker/postfwd-docker.sh in the tarball)
	   Please visit https://postfwd.org/docker for more information.
- code:    standard docker image is now based on alpine linux
           (a debian based Dockerfile can be found at the docker/ subfolder)

- feature: Performance improvement:
	   lists of ip and network objects will now be aggregated
	   automatically using Net::Addr->Compact() function.
	   This can be disabled by the --noaggregate_addrs switch
- feature: argument --cacheid_md5, --nocacheid_md5 for short
	   automatic cacheids (optionally requires Digest::MD5)
- code:    performance and memory tuning for rate-limit code
- code:    Performance and memory tuning for ruleset (mainly hash -> hashref).
	   **********************************************************
	   ** This breaks existing plugins! The <request> argument **
           ** is now called as hash reference instead of a hash!   **
           ** Please look at the manual for more info.             **
	   **********************************************************

- feature: Settings:
	   postfwd program settings can now be saved to and read from
           a configuration file. See --showsettings and --loadsettings=<s>
	   and the manual section "SETTINGS" for more information.
	   Samples can be found in the "etc/"-subfolder of the tarball.

- code:    default for --max_group_items argument changed to 999999
- code:    saved rate limits can now be exchanged between Multiplex and PreFork
- feature: argument --debugclasses shows list of available debug classes
- bugfix:  several small fixes (logging, argument-combinations, ...)
